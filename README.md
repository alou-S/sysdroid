# sysdroid
A python script to show Android Device Temps and Clocks

This python script is more of a personal project. 

It was designed to work with my Samsung M01.
Should theoretically work with most Qualcomm devices of with similar sysfs structure with tweaking the thermal zones.

Tested on a Lenovo Tab 4 10 and works fine.
