# sysdroid
A python script to show Android Device Temps and Clocks

This python script is more of a personal project. 

It was designed to work with my Samsung M01. 
Should theoretically work with most Qualcomm devices of with similar sysfs structure with minor modifications.
Currently tuned for my Redmi Note 11

Tested Devices : 
- Samsung M01
- Lenovo Tab 4 10
- Redmi Note 11
